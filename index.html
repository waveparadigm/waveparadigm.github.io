				<div class="date">2017-6-20</div> Added some more gifs and fixed IE support for the site. Got ahold of the @WaveParadigm Twitter handle, though .com remains illustrious. For now the site is at waveparadigm.tk just to give it a shorter name. Big Palladium is in progress plus level design for Spherical Saunters R/M, Pause, and We 2 Guys. Hoo boy.

				<div class="date">2017-5-9</div> Finally got a WaveParadigm website up and running! Development is still in progress, and I have a lot to show. Acquisition of the waveparadigm .com domain is ongoing.

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>The WaveParadigm name has been involved in over 40 games -- made in a variety of tools ranging from Cave Story modding programs to Unreal Engine 4. I've tackled platformers, puzzle games, racing games, and more.</p>

		<p>I have written well over 25 hours of music in my life, using Pro Tools and FL Studio.</p>
		<p>Upon entering Stevens I joined the <a href="http://sgdc.ml">Stevens Game Development Club</a>; in my sophomore year, I became the organization's President. Education, competition, and comraderie are all things I strive to promote in the game dev world.</p>
